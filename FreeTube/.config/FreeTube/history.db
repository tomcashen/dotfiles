That was the challenge in this moment from “Poor Things,” which stars Emma Stone as a woman with the mind of a baby who, moment by moment, begins to find her footing.\n\nIn this scene, Bella Baxter (Stone) is at dinner with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), her beau of sorts. As she hears the beat of the music and sees others dancing, Bella’s body begins to instinctively move. Suddenly, she’s on the dance floor herself, doing moves she seems to be inventing that are both oddball and intriguing.\n\n“The dance, because she’s doing it for the first time, just felt like it should be something quite primitive, slightly babylike,” the film’s director, Yorgos Lanthimos, said in an interview.\n\nHe collaborated with the choreographer Constanza Macras, with whom he also worked on “The Favourite,” to create the right mix of synergy and chaos in the movement.\n\nLanthimos said that he and the cinematographer Robbie Ryan used a wide-angle lens on a camera mounted on a large metal dolly as they followed the stars. Not only did the movements need to be choreographed, but the cast also had to dance around the roving camera in a way that ensured nobody got hurt.\n\nRead the New York Times review: https://nyti.ms/4aaS1Iz\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it&apos;s reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

Becky (Dreama Walker) is doing her best to get through another tough shift when a man claiming to be a police officer calls to speak with her stressed out manager Sandra (Ann Dowd). According to the man on the phone, Becky has just stolen money from a customer, and likely still has the cash on her person. When Becky denies any wrongdoing, the man on the phone insists that Sandra detain the frightened girl in the back room of the restaurant, an action that sets into motion a shocking sequence of events.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM &amp; © Magnolia Pictures (2012)\nCast: Ashlie Atkinson, Dreama Walker, Ann Dowd\nDirector: Craig Zobel\nProducers: David Gordon Green, Sophia Lin, Lisa Muskat, James Belfer, Craig Zobel, Carina Alves, Eric Hollenbeck, Tyler Davidson\nScreenwriter: Craig Zobel\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

And at 28 years old, I&apos;ve finally managed to buy one. Not only is that incredibly exciting in and of itself, but I also have the skills to service it and this one was having some issues with the sound cutting out at low volumes. That is typically caused by a dirty Pre out/Main in coupling switch on the back of the receiver but can also be cause by dirty speaker relays. There are 3 speaker relays in this receiver, one for each set of speakers! I also checked for a known issue where the pre driver transistors on the driver boards can come loose and destroy the relays or power supply. \n\nThis unit is very clean and I purchased it from the original owner after taking a roadtrip down to Bend, OR in November of 2023. It was super fun to spend time with the original owner and hear about all of his memories using it. I hope that I never have to sell this because to me, it&apos;s the pinnacle of receivers that I could want from the 70&apos;s. \n\nI also recently acquired a second CR 3020 that I will be completely restoring and listing for sale later this year. If you are interested in it, please send me an email. I may need to reveneer it so we could work together on making it a unit that is custom to your tastes.

That was the challenge in this moment from “Poor Things,” which stars Emma Stone as a woman with the mind of a baby who, moment by moment, begins to find her footing.\n\nIn this scene, Bella Baxter (Stone) is at dinner with Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), her beau of sorts. As she hears the beat of the music and sees others dancing, Bella’s body begins to instinctively move. Suddenly, she’s on the dance floor herself, doing moves she seems to be inventing that are both oddball and intriguing.\n\n“The dance, because she’s doing it for the first time, just felt like it should be something quite primitive, slightly babylike,” the film’s director, Yorgos Lanthimos, said in an interview.\n\nHe collaborated with the choreographer Constanza Macras, with whom he also worked on “The Favourite,” to create the right mix of synergy and chaos in the movement.\n\nLanthimos said that he and the cinematographer Robbie Ryan used a wide-angle lens on a camera mounted on a large metal dolly as they followed the stars. Not only did the movements need to be choreographed, but the cast also had to dance around the roving camera in a way that ensured nobody got hurt.\n\nRead the New York Times review: https://nyti.ms/4aaS1Iz\r\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\r\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video\r\n----------\r\nWhether it&apos;s reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.

Robbins (Jennifer Esposito) offers herself in exchange for the hostage and Vanessa (Gisele Bundchen) enjoys frisking her body.\n\nFILM DESCRIPTION:\nAn inept cop suddenly gets a new partner in the person of a cabbie with attitude in this high-rolling comedy. Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) is a police officer who becomes the laughingstock of the department after a series of traffic accidents cause him to lose his driver&apos;s license. One day, Washburn gets an urgent call to head out to the location of a bank robbery; unable to drive himself there, he hails a cab. As it happens, the taxi is being driven by Belle (Queen Latifah), a single mom who, after making a name for herself as the fastest pizza delivery person in New York, has moved up to driving a hack. What begins as a wild ride to the scene of the crime gets even wilder as Washburn and Belle become unexpected allies while following the trail of a team of beautiful but reckless female bank robbers led by Vanessa (Gisele Bundchen).

In the video, the TikToker captures a couple rolling around under a blanket, leading viewers to assume they were engaging in sensual acts. The video quickly went viral, amassing over 40 million views in just two days1.\n\nWhat makes this even more surprising is that the park appears to be quite busy, and the couple’s actions took place in broad daylight. A day later, another angle of the couple, showing them emerging from the blanket, was also uploaded to TikTok and gained significant attention1.\n\nAs expected, reactions have been nonstop on TikTok. Some viewers are shocked by the assumed act and wonder why the couple couldn’t wait until they got home. Others question whether they’ve committed a crime by doing this in public. Interestingly, some people seem to think this is a commonplace activity in New York City parks. One TikToker even played devil’s advocate, reminding viewers that we don’t actually know what was happening under that blanket. Perhaps the man was simply changing clothes! Regardless, the video continues to go viral across social media, inspiring memes and discussions wherever it appears.\n\n\nVideo Of &apos;Love-Making Couple&apos; Under Blanket In NYC Park.\nWhat Is The &apos;NYC Blanket Couple&apos; Video? \nNYC Blanket Couple.

She is also Fellow of the ASU -Santa Fe Institute Center for Biosocial Complex Systems, Founder of the astrobiology-themed social website SAGANet.org, and is a member of the Board of Directors of Blue Marble Space.

Pioneer SX-650","author":"Matt Dealy","authorId":"UC_vkCZh89LoPhNfyAvKgDHw","published":1715646185000,"description":"Back in March of 2024 someone purchased a receiver that I had restored. Shortly after they received it, they messaged me to let me know how much they were enjoying listening to vinyl with their grandson and that brought me a lot of joy. They then asked if I could work on their Pioneer SX 650 stereo receiver that was having issues with the phono section and all of the lamps were out. I want to start offering more services but my time is limited so I said it might take me a couple of months but I&apos;d love to work on it!\n\nI deep cleaned it, replaced some faulty components, fixed any issues I came across, replaced the lamps, and lubricated the controls. It now runs perfectly and this videos shows how I got it there. \n\nIf you have interest in me working on your equipment, shoot me an email (shuksanaudio@gmail.com) with the brand, model, issues, and any other requests for restoration (Wood veneer, lamps, upgrades, etc). As of May 2024, my minimum service charge is $300+ shipping. \n\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro &amp; Background info\n00:36 Throwback to opening the box\n01:33 First Test\n02:49 Exterior cleaning\n03:21 Cleaning the faceplate &amp; knobs\n04:16 Installing LEDs\n06:27 Cleaning the Crackly Controls\n08:33 Hearing back from Randy\n08:48 Electricity Warning\n09:15 Testing Power Supply &amp; Amp Voltages\n09:42 Recapping the Phono stage\n11:35 Burnishing Ground Connections\n11:43 Recapping the Power Supply &amp; Main Amp\n13:39 Servicing the Pre Amp\n14:35 Final testing of all inputs\n15:01 Gluing the Knob Inserts\n15:43 Final Assembly &amp; Closing thoughts\n\n\n••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\nMy name is Matt. I live in Washington State and create content around vintage stereos and other audio equipment.

Due to the poor access, and my lack of familiarity with the cicuit in comparison to the multitrack units which are more in my wheelhouse, it would have taken a long time to resolve these issues. Therefore, the owner opted to move the unit on as a spares donor rather than pay me to fix it, which was a relief honestly.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nTETRAKAN - Fix &amp; Use Tape Recorders\n\nOverviews; tear-downs; repair vlogs; techniques; tutorials; demo recordings...\n...covering every cassette multitrack recorder ever made!* \n*(eventually)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/Tetrakan\n\nTOOLS AND EQUIPMENT I USE;-\nhttps://kit.co/Tetrakan\n\nI post exclusive content on PATREON;-\nhttp://www.patreon.com/tetrakan\n\nIf you are within posting distance of Scotland and would like me to repair or service your multitrack cassette recorder, there is an email contact form provided on my facebook page, or you can message me using facebook or instagram.\n\nDONATIONS are gratefully accepted via my BLOG, which also features written articles and FREE DOWNLOADS OF SERVICE MANUALS;-\nhttps://tetrakansupermonobloc.home.blog/\n\nI prefer to answer questions in the youtube comments where my answers can help more than one person, but if you need to share photos etc, you can message me via facebook. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/tetrakan/\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCHAPTERS\n0:00 Introduction\n0:20 Top Surface decals\n0:26 Dolby Noise reduction\n0:47 Total shut off\n1:10 Three head system\n1:44 A limited tape echo?\n2:12 Tape speed\n2:24 Permalloy heads\n2:51 Predecessors &amp; target audience\n3:15 Track width &amp; recording time\n3:41 One touch record\n4:02 Dual flywheel\n4:16 Mechanical counter &amp; shuttle buttons\n4:23 Review &amp; cue facilities\n5:07 Front panel\n5:11 VU meters\n5:15 Battery check button\n5:23 Record level dials\n6:09 Tone &amp; volume dials\n6:34 Headphone output socket\n6:37 Microphone attenuation button\n6:52 Microphone input sockets\n7:18 Monitor swich\n7:38 Tape select switches - Bias &amp; EQ\n8:18 Dolby Noise reduction switch\n8:22 Rec Select switch\n8:33 ARL, Limiter &amp; Manual modes explained\n9:27 Mains &amp; DC adaptor input sockets\n9:41 speaker on off switch\n9:47 Car battery adaptor accessory\n10:00 Line in &amp; line out RCA sockets\n10:21 DIN Rec Play socket\n10:33 Speaker output sockets\n10:37 L  L+R R switch - speaker &amp; headphone behaviour\n11:02 Battery compartment &amp; battery life\n11:22 Bottom surface decals\n11:55 Size &amp; weight","viewCount":144,"lengthSeconds":767,"watchProgress":767.25696,"timeWatched":1718144660018,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"kZ6ddhLxdj75bkXK","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

The school canceled the dance after McMillen sought to bring her girlfriend and to wear a tuxedo.\n\nAs part of a preliminary ruling, a judge decided that McMillen was allowed to bring a girl as a date. The judge did not order the school to reinstate the prom because it was understood that McMillen would be invited to a prom being held by parents of her Itawamba classmates. Instead, that prom was canceled and was replaced with the sparsely attended country club event.\n\nKristy Bennett, the ACLU&apos;s legal director for Mississippi, told NEMS360, that she was disappointed.\n\n&quot;Whatever we find will be brought to the court&apos;s attention,&quot; Bennett told NEMS. &quot;Whether it is in the damages trial, or whatever. There will still be a trial on the merits. The case didn&apos;t end in the preliminary hearing.&quot;\n\nMcMillen, 18, said that her feelings were hurt, but that there was at least one good thing about the night. The Advocate:\n\nTwo students with learning difficulties were among the seven people at the country club event, McMillen recalls. &quot;They had the time of their lives,&quot; McMillen says. &quot;That&apos;s the one good thing that come out of this, [these kids] didn&apos;t have to worry about people making fun of them [at their prom].&quot;\n\nRead more at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/05/constance-mcmillen-fake-p_n_525856.html\n\nWatch The LARGEST Online News Show at http://www.theyoungturks.com/\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/theyoungturks\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/theyoungturks","viewCount":2423655,"lengthSeconds":444,"watchProgress":15.95012,"timeWatched":1717755707268,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"lPe8htZhwhRteWoo","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}
